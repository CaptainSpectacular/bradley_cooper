title: Static Comp Challenge 1
---

## Specification
The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you'll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don't worry, we'll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer's choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

### Things to Note
 - We have not provided you with any assets, nor native files. You will have to source assets on your own per the creative license guidelines below.

### Creative License
You may NOT take liberties with the layout, but your creative license includes:

* Copy
* Images
* Icons
* Color palette, but ONLY if you select a complementary palette. We highly encourage you to visit sites like: [material palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/) or [coolors](https://coolors.co/) or [color-hex](http://www.color-hex.com/color-palettes/)

### Base Requirements

  - Basic static site setup with `index.html` and `styles.css`
  - Sumbit your work through a PR
